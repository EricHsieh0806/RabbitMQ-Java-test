# RabbitMQ-Java-test
Create a JAVA producer and consumer for test connect RabbitMQ by RabbitMQ Java Client library.

It's sample for test rabbitmq message by RabbitMQ Java client library. 
You can download the java code and compile it on you desktop. 
I recommand you to create a new jar file for perform loop send message. 
The usage script as below command: 
java -cp /rabbitmqtest.jar rabbittest.Producer 10 (The number is for the loop send message count.)
